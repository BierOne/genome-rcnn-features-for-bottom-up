# visual-genome-features-for-updown
This repository supply the visual-genome features of bottom-up-attention.
The extraction follows the original code of peteanderson80([bottom-up-attention](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention)) And I greatly appreciate the peteanderson80's code of bottom-up-attention!

Now the extraction of the genome features is ongoing, I will supply it as soon as possible.

There's my [blog](https://blog.csdn.net/BierOne/article/details/103769431) about this work. Furthurmore, I would be glad if this work could help someone!  Criticism and advice are welcome!
