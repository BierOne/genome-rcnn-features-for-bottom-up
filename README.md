# visual-genome-features-for-updown
This repository supplies the visual-genome features of bottom-up-attention.
The extraction follows the original code of peteanderson80([bottom-up-attention](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention)). Greatly appreciate this code!

There's my [blog](https://blog.csdn.net/BierOne/article/details/103769431) about this work.

Thanks for xingyu's help, I have uploaded the features (10-100 objects features) in baiduNetDisk.
